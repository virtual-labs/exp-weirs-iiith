Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

1. Click/Tap on the **Start** button to start the experiment.
2. The water shall start start flowing through the tap and fill in the container.
3. Notice the slope in water flow that forms when water flows over the weir.
4. Try to change the flow speed by using **Control flow speed** glider. Bringing the glider to the left will slow down the water flow whereas bringing it to the right will speed it up!
5. The **Control flow speed** glider is dynamic and can be changed midway when the water is flowing too. 
6. Click/Tap on the **Reset** button to restart the expeirment afresh, i.e., with empty apparatus.
